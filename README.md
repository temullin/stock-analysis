### Module 2 Berkeley

## Deliverable 1

I was successful in completing all of the requirement of this project.  I code a bit differently in that I put all of my variables at the top of my page so that as I need to find what I named a variable, I don't have to search thru the code to find it.  I also comment each variable so I remember what each variable does. In this project, I also used a variable called FirstTicker to hold the value of the current ticker of each set of records.  I use this variable to check to see if the ticker has changed.  I noted in my comments that this code only works if the data is sorted by the ticker values (column 1).  I am not sure what you want in this section. I wish an example would have been provided.

## Deliverable 2

#### 1. The purpose of this project was to take a large amount of data and condense it into a condensed visualization that the customer could understand the aggregate of the data. The visualization included the use of backgound cell colors to denote if a stock lost or made money.

#### 2. I do not know how to add images and according to the github documentation, it says to click on Wiki, click on the Icon for images and then add the file.  When I click on Wiki, it tells me that I might lose all of my images, I proceed, then it wipes out this message.  this is the 3rd time I have typed it in.  Is there a reason why we can't just use a word document??  There are 2 png files in my resources folder that show the input box to input the year and the output of the code along with the message box that shows the statistics from the timer. The code would be /Resources/VBA_Challenge_2017.png and /Resources/VBA_Challenge_2018.png both of which use relative addressing instead of absolute addressing.

#### 3. 
-The advatages of refactoring code is to allow the code to execute quicker than code that is not written with refactoring in mind.  The more efficient the code, the less resources are used.  The importance of refactoring is paramont when minipulating data with large number of data records.

-The original VBA script is just an example of how this refactored code reduces the use of resourses by writing more efficient code.
